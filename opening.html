	<p id="pageDesc">In chess there's three stages in a game; opening, middle-game, and end-game. The opening phase allows players to select the position they would like to graviate towards that'll benefit them in the middle-game. Both players can influence this, but white has the most influencial move because of they're the ones that move first. Metaphors that represent openigns are books. Every move in a opening is like a sentence in a page of a specific volume of a book, with multiple volumes in a series and multiple series to choose from. A example of a series would be the popular sicilian defense against whites, e4 move. The sicilian defense can turn into: open sicilian, closed sicilian, sicilian dragon, and many more less popular but viable variations of the opening. There are multiple other openings like the sicilian, some of them are: English, Dutch, Scotch, Spanish, Italian, King's Indian, Queen's Indian, etc. All chess players generally know atleast one opening for each side, with more opening knowledge, the better your position will be in the middle-game by adapting to your opponent and countering with another opening or just simply knowing what your opponent wants to do and countering it. To learn openigns, it's incredibly simple because it only involves memorization. Pick one that suits your playstyle and have fun learning the ins and outs of it!</p>

	<p class="openingTextInfo hidden" id="englishInfo">This Chess opening involves the first move c4, (called The English Opening because a group of English players in around the 1890's often played it, including Howard Staunton), it is played as one of the main opening choices for white- an alternative to d4(Queen's Pawn Opening) or e4(King's Pawn Opening). Most positions in this opening are positional in nature rather than the more tactical nature of other openings because white is preparing an attack on the flank, and often fianchettos his bishop with moves such as g3 and bg2 in order to attack a black central pawn mass. The Symetrical English main line: <br>1. c4 c5 <br>2. Nf3 Nc6 <br>3. Nc3 Nf6 <br>4. g3 g6 <br>English Four Knights Opening main line: <br>1. c4 e5 <br>2. Nc3 Nf6 <br>3. Nf3 Nc6 <br>4. g3 d5</p>

	<img class="openingSlide hidden" id="scotchGameImg" src="http://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ScotchGame.jpg" width="250px">
    <p class="openingTextInfo hidden" id="scotchGameInfo">Created by Ercole del Rio in 1750, but had aquirred the "Scotch Game" name in 1824 in the match between Edinburgh and London. The opening has lost popularity in the 20th century with most grandmasters stating that the opening relieves the tension in the center too quickly along with opportunities to let black equalise. The opening has regained some notoriety in recent events with grandmasters opting to use it against the well analized "Ruy Lopez". Standard Scotch Game line is: <br>1. e4 e5 <br>2. Nf3 Nc6 <br>3. d4 <br> There are other variations that lead from this, but can continue with, exd4, 4. Nxd4 Nxd4 5. Qxd4.<br> The Scotch Game can be played both defensive and offensively depending on the player's playstyle. The more passive move after the exd4, Nxd4, Nxd4, Qxd4 is after black moves, white moves his queen back to d1 with Qe5+ being the more aggressive move, checking the black king. </p></div>

    <h3 class="openingTitle hidden" id="dutchDefenseTitle">Dutch Defense Opening</h3>
	<img class="openingSlide hidden" id="dutchDefenseImg" src="http://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/dutch-defense-big.jpg" width="250px">
    <p class="openingTextInfo hidden" id="dutchDefenseInfo">A opening that has very strong opinions about it because of the first from black, f5. This opening has been praise as the best opening against d4 in Elias Stein, the Hague, along with many others, but has also been tagged as unsound by Siegbert Tarrasch in "The Game of Chess" with just as many people favoring the opening as disliking it. The entire strategy behind the Dutch Defense is to voluntarily set a target on the already <i>weak</i> pawn, f7, by pushing it in the begining of the game. This hopefully lures white to focus on the f pawn while black developes and plays without cramped pieces. If white doesn't do this, than black has some ideas of attacking the (usually kingside) castled king. The main line is: <br> 1. d5 f5 <br>This opening has been called unsound because it weakens the kingside and possibly endangering the king in future moves and it doesn't contribute to developing the minor pieces in any way. Along with variations of the Dutch Defense that allows white to gain the upper hand easily. One of them is the Stauton Gambit, main line being: <br>1. d5 f5<br>2. e4 fxe4<br>3. Nc3 Nf6<br>4. Bg5 c6<br>5. f3 exf3</p></div>

	<img class="openingSlide hidden" id="ruyLopezImg" src="http://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/angel.jpg" width="250px">
    <p class="openingTextInfo hidden" id="ruyLopezInfo">Also known as the "Spanish Opening" or "Spanish Game", is very popular amoung low rated player and grandmasters. Named after the spanish bishop, Ruy Lopez de Segura. The opening allows for both offensive and defensive plays. The main line is:<br>1. e4 e5<br>2. Nf3 Nc6<br>3. Bb5<br>After these moves black usually calls the bishops threat with a7 to see if they want to take or retreat. Both options are viable, taking doubles the pawns on the c file, and retreating eventually allows white to position the bishop on a great diagonal with the exception of black advancing their queenside. The line could continue with, 3.Bb5 a7 4. Ba4 b5 5. Bb3. With the bishop positioned on b3, this allows white to launch attacks on the king if he's castled kingside, but black has advanced alittle on the queenside and might try to pressure there in the future.</p></div>

    <h3 class="openingTitle hidden" id="italianGameTitle">Italian Game Opening</h3>
	<img class="openingSlide hidden" id="italianGameImg" src="http://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/the-italian-game.jpg" width="250px">
    <p class="openingTextInfo hidden" id="italianGameInfo">Being one of the oldest openings in chess it has been intenisvely anazlized by many strong players over the years. Players have also called the opening "Giuoco Piano" (but the term refers to the position after 3. Bb5), it's regarded as an Open Game. The main line is:<br>1. e4 e5<br>2. Nf3 Nc6<br>3. Bc4<br>This position have many traps for black with the bishop preparing for a attack on the weak f7 pawn. One line out of the Italian game that is particularly dangerous is, 3. Bc4 Nf6, 4. d3 d6 5. Ng6. This Knight move creates a immediate threat of Nxf7, forking the queen and the rook, and eventually winning the rook out of the start of the game. Generally grandmasters opt for the more aggressive "Spanish Opening" because of the more aggressive and interesting positions the Spanish produces. The Italian can still become incredibly dangerous and can cause the opponent to fall into many traps leading to quick checkmates.</p></div>

    <h3 class="openingTitle hidden" id="kingsIndianDefenseTitle">King's Indian Defense Opening</h3>
	<img class="openingSlide hidden" id="kingsIndianDefenseImg" src="http://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/kings-indian-defense-big.jpg" width="250px">
    <p class="openingTextInfo hidden" id="kingsIndianDefenseInfo">A hypermodern solid opening with good counterplay in the middle game. The King's Indian Defense gives up center control for quick development of pieces and prepares for a counter-attack on the center or wherever white's weaknesses are. Since black givesup the center in this opening, it has a very passive playstyle in the earlier parts of the game, it isn't recommended to players who tend to go very aggressive. Main line is:<br>1. d4 Nf6<br>2. c4 g6<br>The opening does allow for early king-side castling. Since black doesn't generally move a piece past the 6th rank during the opening phase, pieces in the King's Indian Defense are liable to become crammed and block each other. This weakness can sometimes be abused and it takes alot of strategy and foresight to avoid this. </p></div>

    <h3 class="openingTitle hidden" id="openSicilianTitle">Open Silican Opening</h3>
	<img class="openingSlide hidden" id="openSicilianImg" src="http://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/sicilian-big.jpg" width="250px">
    <p class="openingTextInfo hidden" id="openSicilianInfo">A variation off of the Sicilian Defense. This variation allows black to sack the c pawn for white's d pawn and open up the center. Main line is:<br>1. e4 c5<br>2. Nf3 signals the open Sicilian and the line continues with d6 from black<br>3. d4 cxd4<br>4. Nxd4 Nf6<br>5. Nc3<br>This variation can also transpose into other variations such as, the Dragon or the Najdorf which are all good openings to play. The Silician is enormous with numerous variations that can be played with long lines of theory. The Open Sicilian just leads to other variations.</p></div>
    
    <div class="openingContainer">
    <h3 class="openingTitle hidden" id="queensGambitTitle">Queen's Gambit Opening</h3>
	<img class="openingSlide hidden" id="queensGambitImg" src="http://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/QueensGambit-e1346610053936.jpg" width="250px">
    <p class="openingTextInfo hidden" id="queensGambitInfo">A opening that white sacrifices a pawn in the first few moves to gain a advantage in development. This opening can become very complex and if played incorrectly, can become a dangerous hole in which white can never recover from. The Queen's Gambit also can be a tool that completely destorys black because of his lack of development. Main line is: <br>1. d4 d5<br>2. c4<br>At the very start of the gambit black will have two options, to accept or decline the gambit. Declining the gambit usually leads to a normal opening, but accepting it leads to interesting positions. It is important to note that if you're playing against this opening, to either decline it, or to never take the second pawn sacrifice and to give up the pawn.</p></div>
