        <h3>Basics of Chess</h3>
            <p>Chess has a basic objective, to checkmate the opponent's king while remainning un-checkmated yourself.</p> 
        <h4>Preparation and Game Rules</h4>
            <p>Before the game, the board must have a white square in the bottom right. Pieces must be arranged with 8 pawns sitting on the second (if white) or seventh (if black) ranks, rooks at the four corners, followed by (moving towards the center two squares) Knights, Bishops, than the Queen and the King (Queen on the "d4" square and King on the "e4" square). At the start of the game the sides are basically equal, but white always moves first with black following the next, than white, than black, etc. . You're allowed to move only one piece in one turn. Only one piece is allowed to occupy the square that it is currently standing on.</p> 
        <h4>Pawns</h4>
            <p>The Pawns are allowed to move 2 (or 1) squares FORWARD at the start of the game, followed by 1 square FOWARD after that. They cannot move DIAGONALLY or HORIZONALLY. They're allowed to capture diagonally (and sometimes horizonally if certain conditions are met). If a pawn has reached the opposite side of the board from which it has started from it'll be allowed to "promote". Promoting is exclusive to only pawns, and this action allows pawns to become a: Rook, Knight, Bishop, or Queen. This promotion is mandatory and the pawn cannot promote himself to a King piece.</p>
        <h4>Rooks</h4>
            <p>The Rooks are the castle like pieces at the corners of the board. Rooks are allowed to move as far HORIZONTALLY or VERTICALLY as the players want within the borders of the chess board (and if it doesn't have other pieces to block its movements). They can also capture this way, but cannot move past a friendly or enemy piece. Rooks are also used in maneuver called "castling" that also involves the King and a Rook swapping places to insure relative safety of the king. See "<a href="#"><span>Castling</span></a>" in the lessons page of the website to learn more.</p>
        <h4>Knights</h4>
            <p>The Knights are the peices that look like horses, they generally start to the side of the Rook. They are the only piece in the game that can "jump" over other pieces while moving to their desired location. Knights can move in a "L" formation, jumping over pieces in the process. This "L" formation is only 2 (or 3) left or right, and 3 ( or 2) up and down. They cannot move 2 to the left and 2 to up, they must move 2 squares in one direction than 3 in another. They're great for capturing or threatening pieces like the queens, rooks, or bishops because of their unique movement. But their control range is generally pretty short and limited so they generally should be close to action/center. </p>
        <h4>Bishops</h4>
            <p>The Bishops are the pieces that are positioned in between the Knights and Queen/King. They somewhat resemble a catholic bishop in appearance, but are smoothed over. Bishops can move and capture DIAGONALLY, but not HORIZONALLY OR VERTICALLY. They're great for penetrating through walls of pawns that are positioned in diagonals on the opposite colored squares that the Bishop is on. They're also good in both the center of the board, and the corners of the board (as long as they remain unblocked by friendly or enemy pieces</p>
        <h4>Queens</h4>
            <p>The Queens are the pieces positioned to the left of the Kings at the start of the game. Queens are hybrids of a rook and a bishop and can move in those rules. They cannot move in "L" formations and cannot jump or other pieces. They're considered the must important piece (that isn't the King) because of the flexibility of their movements and the potenital for captures. So because of this, they're generally kept in relative safety (with the exception of calculated sacrafices for checkmates or for more captured pieces).</p>
        <h4>Kings</h4>
            <p>The Kings are generally one of the tallest pieces with a cross or crown on the top of them. Kings have infinite value in the game because if they're checkmated, the person loses. But with infinite value, the Kings are only allowed to move only one square in any direction (as long as its free of any other piece). They can still capture pieces like this, but they generally don't get the chance for most of the game. Ensuring King safety is one of the key factors of chess if a player is gonna lose or win a match. "<a href="#"><span>Castling</span></a>" is a great method to do so, learn more about "<a href="#"><span>Castling</span></a>" in the "Lessons" page of the website.</p>
        <h4>Conculsion</h4>
            <p>With this knowledge, you can being to start and play BASIC chess and learn openings, castling, tactics, and more if you chose to continue on playing this beautiful game.</p></div>
